## What's this?

Status is a simple web-based system monitoring tool targetting small homeservers running Linux.

It utilizes virtual filesystems (like `/sys`, `/proc` etc.) to retrieve hardware/software information and pass it straight to the end-user via nice, pleasant web interface.


## Why?

I created Status because I couldn't find a suitable app for me. Also, I enjoy making things like this.
- :feather: It is lightweight as it uses small amount of dependencies
- :desktop_computer: Provides nice web UI (still working on it)
- :nerd_face: Provides fair enough information about your machine


## Note

Status might be kinda unstable, as it's been tested only on few devices. Yet, I'm doing my best to provide best support for wide range of setups.
