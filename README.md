# Status v2

**Don't use it now. This is highly unstable and breakages will occur!**

This is a rewritten version of Status. Targets:

üî® Code is more flexible and organized

üñ•Ô∏è UI is refreshed, providing new cool features with even more pleasant look

‚ÑπÔ∏è Providing more information in better, more readable way

‚öñÔ∏è More stability


### What now works

Status should now work as expected. Expect bugs as a large amount of changes was made to this project. Breakages will still occur.

After thorough tests and bug fixes it will be released as stable.

Frontend seems to be ready. However, code still can be organized in a more convenient way.

I think it's ready to be released as `main` after some testing.
