## What is it?

A simple server monitoring app written in Python.
Designed to be lightweight, simple and pleasant to use.


## How to host it?

### Install required stuff:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### And, simply run:

```python3 status.py```

**Status is now served on [localhost:9000](localhost:9000).**

If the app crashes, please see the next section.


## Configuration

If you encounter a crash or you want to setup stuff on your own, keep reading.

There's no config at all, coz I was too lazy for that.

**Please open `status.py` file and follow the comments.** It's easy, really.
